##Key Objectives
‚Ä¢	‚Ä¢ Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover sales trends and customer behavior
‚Ä¢	‚Ä¢ Identify top-performing countries and products
‚Ä¢	‚Ä¢ Engineer features like InvoiceHour and MonthYear for time-based analysis
‚Ä¢	‚Ä¢ Segment customers using RFM analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)
‚Ä¢	‚Ä¢ Build classification models to predict customer segments
##Dataset Overview
‚Ä¢ Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
‚Ä¢ Size: 500,000+ records from a UK-based online retailer
‚Ä¢ Features: InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, Country
## Key Insights
‚Ä¢	‚Ä¢ Peak Sales Hours: Most purchases happen between 9 AM ‚Äì 12 PM
‚Ä¢	‚Ä¢ Top Countries: UK dominates transactions, followed by the Netherlands and Germany
‚Ä¢	‚Ä¢ Product Trends: Certain gift items and holiday-themed products were consistently top-selling
‚Ä¢	‚Ä¢ Customer Segments: RFM analysis helped group customers into four tiers for targeted marketing
‚Ä¢	‚Ä¢ Modeling: Classification models achieved high accuracy in predicting customer loyalty segments
## Techniques Used
‚Ä¢	‚Ä¢ Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
‚Ä¢	‚Ä¢ Data cleaning & handling missing values
‚Ä¢	‚Ä¢ Feature engineering (hour, day, country flags)
‚Ä¢	‚Ä¢ RFM segmentation using quantiles
‚Ä¢	‚Ä¢ Classification (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
## Deliverables
‚Ä¢	‚Ä¢ üìì Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step EDA and modeling
‚Ä¢	‚Ä¢ üìå PDF version of notebook (for non-technical reviewers)
‚Ä¢	‚Ä¢ üìÅ Clean, organized dataset and outputs
